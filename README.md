Adds Sublime Merge commands to VSCode/VSCodium.

To differentiate between other Sublime Merge plugins, this one isn't concerned with what workspace (multi or single) you have setup.

Whatever file you have open, it will traverse up the directory structure and find the appropriate `.git` repository.

## Features
